# Marketing-Campaign-Optimization
Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign.

The analysis was built around the concept of being able to sell to the hypothetical company that provided the data, a product that it was able to apply to improve and / or optimize future marketing campaigns.

The project is divided into the following reports:
Report 1: Descriptive Dataset Analyzes (EDA)
Report 2: Cleaning of the dataset and estimation of some "missing values"
Report 3: Models to estimate the response variable relating to our dataset ("purchase or not of a product")
To each of them are connected the relative comments made for almost all of the written codes and the resulting result (as well as an interpretation when necessary).
